            <pre>Why We Love Kampot, Cambodia
                What is it that we loved about this small town that most visitors bypass in favour of the Angkor temples at Siem Reap or the beaches in Sihanoukville?

            <p>Sihanoukville is a province in southwest Cambodia known for its beaches, tropical islands and the mangrove jungles of Ream National Park. Set around a deep-water port on a peninsula jutting into the Gulf of Thailand, the provincial capital of Sihanoukville has palm-fringed beaches, seafood restaurants and late-night bars. Overlooking the capital is the hilltop Buddhist temple of Wat Leu.</p>

        <pre class="text">Preah Sihanouk Province is a province (khaet) in southwest Cambodia on the Gulf of Thailand. The provincial capital, 
            
            also called Sihanoukville, is a deep water port city and a steadily growing and diversifying urban center on an elevated peninsula.[4]

            First established as Kampong Som , the province was later renamed in honor of former King Norodom Sihanouk, who orchestrated 
            the establishment of Sihanoukville city and the Sihanoukville municipality as this took place alongside the construction of the Sihanoukville Port, 
            which commenced in June 1955. The only deep water port of Cambodia, it includes an oil terminal and a transport logistics facility.[5][6]
            
            Preah Sihanouk is divided into four districts, each with a distinct economic character, defined largely by location and access to resources.[7] In addition 
            to the port and the growing tourism industry, the activities of countless NGOs and international investment have contributed to the rapid economic growth of 
            the province over the course of the last decade.[8] Primary economic sectors are transport and logistics, process manufacturing, agriculture and fisheries, textiles,
            and real estate.
